# The four-step approach to a job aid!

inputs are needed to complete it. Decide on a goal for the job aid, and how best execute.

<h3>Pick Job Aid Format üí≠</h3>


Choose a common job aid format such a flowchart or step-by-step infographic. Decide on the size and medium of the job aid (print or digital?). Create an outline based on what your audience needs to know to accomplish their goal. Plan to replace text with images like screenshot and icon as much as possible.

<h3>Write the Job Aid ‚å®Ô∏è</h3>

Your job aid should be as concise as possible. Use short words, and short sentences. Start your sentences with action verbs. Any icons or illustrations should have a consistent style and theme. Stick to two to three colors. Use a template if necessary.

<h3>Test the Job Aid in the Real-World üì≤</h3>

Distribute the job aid to your audience. Encourage the to use it. Ask for feedback and revise the job aid as needed. Review the results: Are there less FAQ‚Äôs asked to supervisors or managers? Are task done more accurate? Higher satisfaction rating?
